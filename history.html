        <h3>Founding of the Canadian Dominion</h3><br>
        <p>In mid-January 2024, greymesa, a longtime member of Imperial Japan and a real-life Canadian, set out to
          recreate a Canadian nation on CCNet. After claiming the fallen town of St_Lawrence in Quebec, he was
          preemptively sieged by LeDuxBerrie of Columbia, who suspected it was a Japanese outpost. After losing the
          town, greymesa relocated to the current site of Nova Prospekt, near allied fort Ravenrock.<br><br>
          He teamed up with OGHunt4Life (mayor of Grand Torontonia) and TerryTheThird (mayor of Halifax) to form the
          Canadian Dominion. Despite early harassment from enemies like TheRiseOfKiller and DanBaoRen, greymesa
          persisted—laying the foundation for Nova Prospekt, which would become the primary fort of the new Canadian
          nation.</p>

        <h3>The First Siege of Nova Prospekt</h3><br>
        <p>Tensions escalated when Floritânia, led by Fake4, began consistently camping Canadian towns, targeting them
          for their lack of PvPers. Claiming Canada’s Coalition alignment as justification, Floritânia launched a siege
          on Nova Prospekt, which was still under construction and vulnerable.<br><br>
          Recognizing the situation, Canada strategically placed the white banner, avoiding further losses while
          focusing on completing the fort. A revolt was planned for after its fortifications were ready.

        <h3>Founding of the Kingdom of Greenland</h3><br>
        <p>On March 9th, OnlyIvanix and Kuzifix1210 joined CCNet and founded Lunegrad on Greenland’s western coast.
          Starting as a small port-town, Lunegrad rapidly grew, attracting players like 3VSL and Criss_cloudy, and
          reaching 20 residents in just a week.<br><br>
          Inspired to form a nation, Kuzifix founded Windguard at Greenland’s center, soon joined by Criss_cloudy, who
          established Fort_Era, the main stronghold. With Ivan crowned king and the Kingdom of Greenland officially
          formed, the capital Windguard quickly grew past 100 residents. The early Greenlandic towns—Betegard
          (Bulbagrad), Old Town, Nordligmakt, and Inuit—laid the foundation for one of the north’s most resilient
          empires.</p>
